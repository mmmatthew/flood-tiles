# flood-tiles
A Web app for simulating simple inundation scenarios on the fly, in any modern browser. 

The implementation of HTML5 canvas layers in the [leaflet mapping library](http://leafletjs.com/) is largely inspired and partially copied from Mapbox's excellent example of [in-browser hillshade rendering](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/dynamic-hill-shading/)
